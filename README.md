# DBInterface

I try to implement the Keywords search interface over MySQL
from the paper 
"Efficient IR-Style Keyword Search over Relational 
Databases" by V. Hristidis et al.  

The architecture consists of three components: IR Engine, 
Candidate Network Generator, and Execution Engine. 

Then I found the source code for Spark2, so I just implement my
ideas based on the code. You can check their paper "Spark: top-k keyword query in relational databases" 
by Yi Luo, Xuemin Lin, Wei Wang and Xiaofang Zhou.
