# DBInterface

I try to implement the Keywords search interface over MySQL
from the paper 
"Efficient IR-Style Keyword Search over Relational 
Databases" from V. Hristidis et al.  

The architecture consists of three components: IR Engine, 
Candidate Network Generator, and Execution Engine. 

After implementing this, I would try to improve the performance.
